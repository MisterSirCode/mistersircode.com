            <p>
                Im an amatuer programmer and 3D artist. I go by the nickname "SirCode" or "MisterSirCode" online.
                Ive been writing in a multitude of languages over the last nine or so years.
                Im currently working towards my college tuition to follow a major in Computer Science.
                Below Ive included a gallery of some of my art. 
                I dabble in CGI aswell as demoscene (Shader Art) and even digital painting occasionally.
